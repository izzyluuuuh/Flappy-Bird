# Flappy Bird
<sup>Game Development</sup>

## This is a remake of the Mobile game Flappy Bird.

The ***game*** uses the `LÃ–VE game engine` and _several external libraries_, including push for virtual resolution and Class for object-oriented programming. The game also uses a _StateMachine_ class to smoothly transition between different game states.

At the start of the game, the player is presented with a _title screen_ where they can start the game by pressing `Enter` key. The game then transitions to a _countdown state_ where the player is given a few seconds to prepare before the game starts. 
During the game, the player must avoid pipes that are generated procedurally and move from right to left. Pressing the `'P' button` allows the player to **Pause/Resume** the game. 
If the player _collides with a pipe_, the game **ends** and the player is taken to a score state where they can see their `final score`.

The game uses several images and sounds to create a retro aesthetic. The background and ground are constantly scrolled to give the illusion of movement. The game also uses a custom font for the text.

Overall, Flappy Bird Remake '24 is a simple but challenging game that is easy to pick up and play. The procedural generation of pipes adds an element of unpredictability to the game, making it more challenging and replayable.
